Dependency Injection Documentation
==================================

.. warning:: This Document Page Under Construction

**Dependency Injection** is a technique in which an object receives other
objects that it depends on, called dependencies. Typically, the receiving
object is called a client and the passed-in ('injected') object is called a
service. The code that passes the service to the client is called the injector.
Instead of the client specifying which service it will use, the injector tells
the client what service to use. The 'injection' refers to the passing of a
dependency (a service) into the client that uses it.
