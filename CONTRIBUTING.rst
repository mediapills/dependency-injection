How to contribute
=================

There are lots of ways to contribute to the project. People with different
expertise can help to improve the web content, the documentation, the code,
and the tests. Even this README file is a result of collaboration of multiple
people.

**unit tests** : A software project is as good as its tests are.
Following this simple idea, we are trying to cover the integration
capabilities with automated tests. If you're passionate about the quality -
please consider chiming in.

**doc** : Have you seen a project that doesn't need to improve its
documentation?!

**website** : We are using GH pages to build and manage the site's content.
If you're interested in making it better, check-out `gh-pages` branch and dig in.
If you are not familiar with the `Github Pages <https://pages.github.com>`_
- check it out, it's pretty simple yet powerful!

**giving feedback** : Tell us how you use maediapills.dependency-injection, what was great and what was
not so much. Also, what are you expecting from it and what would you like to
see in the future? Opening `an issue <https://github.com/mediapills/dependency-injection/issues>`_
will grab our attention. Seriously, this is the great way to contribute!

Roles
-----

Much like projects in
`ASF <https://www.apache.org/foundation/how-it-works.html#roles>`_,
Mediapills recognizes a few roles. Unlike ASF's projects, our structure is a way
simpler.
There are only two types:

A Contributor
  is a user who contributes to a project in the form of code or documentation.
  Developers take extra steps to participate in a project,are active on the
  developer forums, participate in discussions, provide PRs (patches),
  documentation, suggestions, and criticism. Contributors are also known as
  developers.

A Committer
  is a developer that was given write access to the code repository. Not
  needing to depend on other people to commit their patches, they are actually
  making short-term decisions for the project. By submitting your code or other
  content to the project via PR or a patch, a Committer agrees to transfer the
  contribution rights to the Project. From time to time, the project's
  committership will go through the list of contributions and make a decision to
  invite new developers to become a project committer.

RTC model
---------

Mediapills supports Review-Then-Commit model of development. The following
rules are used in the RTC process:

- a developer should seek peer-review and/or feedback from other developers
through the PR mechanism (aka code review).

- a developer should make a reasonable effort to test the changes before
submitting a PR for review.

- any non-document PR is required to be opened for at least 24 hours for
community feedback before it gets committed unless it has an explicit +1
from a committer

- any non-document PR needs to address all the comment and reach consensus
before it gets committed without a +1 from other committers

- a committer can commit documentation patches without explicit review
process. However, we encourage you to seek the feedback.
